        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 27, 2025</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Murat Can Çiçek ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects the information of users ("you") of the <strong>Dog Identifier</strong> mobile application (the "App"). By using our App, you agree to the data practices described in this Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a transparent approach to data handling.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>To provide the core functions of our App, we need to collect certain types of information. We collect information directly from you when you use the App, and automatically as you navigate through the App.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Image Data:</strong> When you use the App's primary feature to identify a dog breed, you will take or select a photo from your device's camera or gallery. These photos are processed by our artificial intelligence service (Google Gemini API) solely for the purpose of identifying the dog breed.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Processing:</b> Images are temporarily uploaded to the AI service for analysis.</li>
                    <li><b>Storage:</b> To enable the "History" feature, where you can review your past identifications, the photos you submit and the identification results are securely stored on our cloud servers (Firebase Storage and Firebase Firestore) and linked to your user account.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-Personal Use:</b> We do not use your images for any purpose other than providing the identification service and maintaining your history. We do not sell or share your individual images with third parties for their own purposes, beyond what is necessary for service provision.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>User Account Data (Firebase Authentication):</strong> To allow you to save your identification history and access it across devices, our App uses Firebase Authentication. This may involve:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Anonymous User IDs:</b> Upon first launch, an anonymous user ID (UUID) may be created for you automatically. This allows you to use the history feature without personal sign-up.</li>
                    <li><b>Future Authentication Methods:</b> Should we introduce additional sign-in methods (e.g., email/password, Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In), we would collect the necessary authentication credentials associated with those services.</li>
                    <li><b>Purpose:</b> This data is used solely for managing your account, providing secure access to your identification history, and personalizing your App experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Identification History Data:</strong> The results of your dog identifications (including breed name, confidence score, descriptive information generated by AI) are stored in Firebase Firestore, linked to your user account. This data allows you to review your past identification sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data & Analytics (Firebase Analytics):</strong> We collect anonymous and aggregated usage data to understand how users interact with our App, improve its performance, identify potential errors (e.g., crash reports), and inform future feature development. This data may include your device model, operating system version, app usage patterns, and crash logs. This data does not personally identify you. Firebase is a service provided by Google.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Information (Optional):</strong> If you choose to contact us via email through the "Contact Us" option in the App's Settings menu, we will collect your email address and any information you choose to provide in your message. This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry and provide support.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>To Provide and Maintain the App Services:</b> To process the photos you submit, identify dog breeds, generate detailed dog guides, and offer the "Dog Expert Assistant" features. This includes storing your identification history.</li>
            <li><b>To Improve and Optimize the App:</b> To analyze usage data, fix bugs, enhance user experience, and develop new features based on user behavior and performance insights.</li>
            <li><b>To Manage Your Account:</b> To provide secure access to your identification history, synchronize your data across devices, and manage your authentication status within the App.</li>
            <li><b>For Communication:</b> To respond to your inquiries and provide customer support when you reach out to us.</li>
            <li><b>For Legal Compliance:</b> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App and providing its services. These third parties are obligated to protect your data in accordance with their own privacy policies and applicable laws.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google (Gemini API):</strong> Your submitted images and textual queries are sent to the Gemini API for processing to identify dog breeds and generate comprehensive guides. Google's privacy policy is available <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Used for backend services including user authentication (Firebase Authentication), storing identification history and associated images (Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage), and collecting anonymous usage analytics and crash reports (Firebase Analytics). Google's privacy policy applies to Firebase services.</li>
            <li><strong>Adapty:</strong> We use Adapty for managing premium subscriptions and in-app purchases. Your payment transactions are processed directly by Apple through the App Store; Adapty does not handle your payment information directly but manages your subscription status and entitlements. You can review Adapty's privacy policy <a href="https://adapty.io/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Law Enforcement & Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement reasonable and industry-standard security measures, including those provided by Firebase's secure infrastructure, to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. While we strive to protect your data, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We retain your personal data (such as user account IDs, identification history, and associated images) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the App's services and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you wish to delete your account or specific history data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@youremail.com">support@youremail.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights (GDPR & Other Regulations)</h2>
