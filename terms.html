        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 27, 2025</p>

        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>
            By accessing or using the <strong>Dog Identifier</strong> mobile application (the "App"), provided by Murat Can Çiçek, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the App. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version on this page. Your continued use of the App after any such modifications constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
            The App is a service that allows users to identify dog breeds by uploading photos via their mobile device's camera or gallery and to obtain detailed information about dog breeds through an AI-powered "Dog Expert Assistant". The identification results and information provided by the assistant are for informational purposes only. The accuracy, completeness, or reliability of this information is not guaranteed. It is strongly recommended to consult a qualified veterinarian or a professional dog trainer/behaviorist before acting on information provided, especially regarding your pet's health, training, or behavior.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            To use certain features of the App, such as saving your identification history, you will have an associated user account. This account may be created automatically (e.g., as an anonymous user) or through future authentication methods. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
        </p>

        <h2>4. User Content</h2>
        <p>
            When you upload photos to the App for dog identification, you retain all ownership rights to your images. However, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, reproduce, and process your uploaded images solely for the purpose of providing the App's services (i.e., identifying dog breeds and storing your history). We will not use your images for any other purpose without your explicit consent.
        </p>

        <h2>5. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
            The App may offer in-app purchases or auto-renewing subscriptions ("Premium Services") that provide access to additional features.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Payment:</b> Payments will be charged to your Apple App Store account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
            <li><b>Renewal:</b> Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. The renewal fee will be charged to your account within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
            <li><b>Management:</b> You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your App Store Account Settings after purchase.</li>
            <li><b>Service Provider:</b> We use Adapty for the subscription management infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
            The App and its original content, features, functionality, branding, and design (excluding user-provided images and content from third-party APIs as described in our Privacy Policy) are and will remain the exclusive property of Murat Can Çiçek and its licensors. The App is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws of Turkey and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Murat Can Çiçek.

        <ul>
            <li>Using the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
            <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to any part of the App or its related systems or networks.</li>
            <li>Decompiling, reverse-engineering, or disassembling the source code of the App.</li>
            <li>Using any automated system (e.g., robot, spider, scraper) that could interfere with the proper working of the App or place an unreasonable load on its servers.</li>
            <li>Transmitting any content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
            <li>Using the App in any way that violates any applicable local, national, or international law or regulation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
            The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Murat Can Çiçek makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the App or the information, content, or materials included therein. To the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, Murat Can Çiçek disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. We make no warranty as to the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the dog identification results or the information provided by the AI assistant.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        </p>
